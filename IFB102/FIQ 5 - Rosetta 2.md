```Rosetta 2
Explain how Rosetta 2 enables new M1 Macs to run Intel code. Explain the problem, how it arose and how Rosetta 2 solves the problem.
```

1. What is Rosetta 2?
	Translation layer for x86-64 machine code to run on ARM
2. Why does Apple want to run Intel code on their Macs?
	Encourage universality, which is a method of circumventing complexity.
1. How did the problem arise?
2. What is complexity?
3. How does universality combat complexity?
4. What benefits does Rosetta 2's universality provide?
5. What does Rosetta 2 do to combat complexity? How does it work?
