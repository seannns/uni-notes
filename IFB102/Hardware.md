# What is a computer?
A computer is a general purpose device qwhich can be programmed to carry out a set of data processing operations.
	Contains stored program of instructions
	Can be reprogrammed

Alan Turing created the Turing Machine
	Abstract computing machine, captures the *essence of computing.*

Hardware
	Physical computer that runs programs, eg. chips.
	Fast, expensive to design + produce, fixed.

Software
	Computer programs that instruct the computer what to do.
	Slow, cheap, flexible (reprogrammable)

Programmability
	Flexibility, Customisation, Adaption, Extension, Upgradeability
	Some computers with fixed devices aren't programmable (eg. Fridge)

How do computers work?
	Do simple things quickly, eg. calculations
	1.5 GHz = 1.5 billion instructions in 1 second.
