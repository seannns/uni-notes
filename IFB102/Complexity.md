Complexity
	Computer systems are very complex, but complexity slows down processing.
	Size of systems contribute to complexity: billions of transistors operating billions of times per second.
	Rapid evolution contributes to complexity: how can software keep up with Moore's Law.

Ways to combat complexity
	Universality - eg. programming languages
	Hierarchical Abstraction - programming libraries

Universality
	Universal model of computation - powerful enough to compute all that can be computed.
		eg. Universal Turing Machine
	Anything that can be computed can be computed by a Universal Turing Machine.
	If a system is Turing equivalent, it can compute anything computable.

Programming Languages
	To simplify computers we must make them closer to humans.
		eg. make the language closer to human.
	Programming is the ultimate form of system configuration.

Emulators
	Universality allows us to emulate CPUs in software.
	eg. Game emulators let us run old console games on newer, different hardware.

Hierarchical Abstraction
	Software Libraries
	Essentially means hiding layers.
