Complexity
	Computer systems are very complex, but complexity slows down processing.
	Size of systems contribute to complexity: billions of transistors operating billions of times per second.
	Rapid evolution contributes to complexity: how can software keep up with Moore's Law.

Ways to combat complexity
	Universality - eg. programming languages
	Hierarchical Abstraction - programming libraries

Universality
	Universal model of computation - powerful enough to compute all that can be computed.
		eg. Universal Turing Machine
	Anything that can be computed can
