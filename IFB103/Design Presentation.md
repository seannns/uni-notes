### Introduce your app.
This - is Cuppa. You might not have heard of it before.

Cuppa is an app that gives coffee aficionados a chance to find new cafes, learn to make new drinks and meet with fellow coffee connoisseurs, all in one simple, intuitive app. 

### Describe the problem space you wish to solve in detail.
When most of us are trying to find new restaurants or cafes to go to, we usually default to Google or word of mouth. But these recommendations are cumbersome and hardly ever work out. What if you got to a cafe, and found they didn't offer soy milk? Or you got there and realised you were in the "rich" part of town?

It's incredibly difficult to experiment with the cafes you visit, yet the more you default to the regular, the less you feel that same spark of enjoyment and energy that coffee once gave you. And slowly emerging out of lockdowns, it's been hard to get that coffee mix while meeting acquaintances, joining clubs, or just striking up a conversation.

### Show the outputs of your complete competitor analysis, emphasising the gap in the market.

We compared Cuppa to the four most relevant competitors in Apple's App Store market. We assessed things like map integration, event scheudling, social features, tutorial features, as well as consideration of taste preferences and dietary requirements. Certain apps offer very refined forms of these features; like OpenTable, with a range of taste preference settings, a detailed map, and a significant scheduling implementation. However, OpenTable is more of a specialty app - there aren't any social features and there are no recipes or tutorials available.

Yelp faced similar issues; strong taste preference considerations, efficient reservations, easy-to-view and easy-to-read reviews... but again, no social interaction and no recipes or tutorials.

Or, consider Google Maps. While not explicitly an app for finding restaurants or foods, it does have some features available making it a more generalist implementation than OpenTable. While - of course - the map is of the best available, it once again completely lacks any social interaction, it has no taste preferences, or recipes, nor can you even view the items or menu of a location. 

So what hole does this leave in the market? Consider - it's a lot more intuitive to have one app on your phone than several. And this is where Cuppa becomes an attractive offering. The two features offered over *all* of the analysed competitors are social interactions and a tutorial/recipe interface. With current, available apps, you would need at least three to complete the role Cuppa exists for. Yelp, Google Maps or OpenTable for finding cafe's, Facebook or competing social media apps for any social
