### Describe the problem space you wish to solve in detail.
When most of us are trying to find new restaurants or cafes to go to, we usually default to Google or word of mouth. But these recommendations are cumbersome and hardly ever work out. What if you got to a cafe, and found they didn't offer soy milk? Or you got there and realised you were in the "rich" part of town?

It's incredibly difficult to experiment with the cafes you visit, yet the more you default to the regular, the less you feel that same spark of enjoyment and energy that coffee once gave you. And slowly emerging out of lockdowns, it's been hard to get that coffee mix while meeting acquaintances, joining clubs, or just striking up a conversation.

### Introduce your app.
This - is Cuppa.

Cuppa is an app that gives coffee aficionados a chance to find new cafes, learn to make new drinks and meet with fellow coffee connoisseurs, all in one simple, intuitive app. 

### Discuss in detail your user demographic and why they would like your app. (LUCAS)

Cuppa is built first and foremost for young adults living, working and studying in cities or high population density locations. In expansive metropolises synonymous with individualist mentality, we aimed to propose a method through which users could not only just grab a coffee, but maybe make a couple of human connections at the same time... or even learn a new skill in their hectic schedule. Additionally, there are a lot of options for dietary requirements as well as taste preferences such that we can cater to the needs of coffee afficionados, but the app is intuitive enough to the point where even someone who has never taken a sip of coffee before can find exactly what they'd enjoy and what cafe's to visit to suit their personal preferences.

Consider a user who, for this example, we can call "John." John is 20, and is studying full time while working a part time job. Coming out of several lockdowns due to COVID-19, it's been hard for him to meet with friends and he's mainly been getting his coffee fix at home, with boxed soy milk and instant coffee powder.  Now that we're at the point where lockdowns are easing off, John's been itching to try out any of the cafe's around the city, and he's feeling a bit desperate to meet a couple friends and acquaintances, new or old.

That is essentially what Cuppa offers. We think it's the right time, right now, to capitalise on the lack of social interaction so many of us have experienced throughout the pandemic, and offer something that can, in a way, rejuvenate our social person.  On this line of thinking, we also thought - what's more synonymous with city dwellers than expensive coffee on a daily basis? Why not give an easy opportunity to both get your coffee and meet someone new at the same time?

### Show the outputs of your complete competitor analysis, emphasising the gap in the market.

We compared Cuppa to the four most relevant competitors in Apple's App Store market. We assessed things like map integration, event scheudling, social features, tutorial features, as well as consideration of taste preferences and dietary requirements. Certain apps offer very refined forms of these features; like OpenTable, with a range of taste preference settings, a detailed map, and a significant scheduling implementation. However, OpenTable is more of a specialty app - there aren't any social features and there are no recipes or tutorials available.

Yelp faced similar issues; strong taste preference considerations, efficient reservations, easy-to-view and easy-to-read reviews... but again, no social interaction and no recipes or tutorials.

Or, consider Google Maps. While not explicitly an app for finding restaurants or foods, it does have some features available making it a more generalist implementation than OpenTable. While - of course - the map is of the best available, it once again completely lacks any social interaction, it has no taste preferences, or recipes, nor can you even view the items or menu of a location. 

So what hole does this leave in the market? Consider - it's a lot more intuitive to have one app on your phone than several. And this is where Cuppa becomes an attractive offering. The two features offered over *all* of the analysed competitors are social interactions and a tutorial/recipe interface. With current, available apps, you would need at least three to complete the role Cuppa exists for. Yelp, Google Maps or OpenTable for finding cafe's, Facebook or competing social media apps for any social interaction to schedule events or meetups, then finally one of many recipe aggregate apps to learn how to make particular coffees at home. 

This doesn't just take up dwindling storage space on a device - it's also just flatout cumbersome. Consider the current user journey of someone trying to try out a new cafe. First, they go to Google Maps to find all the cafe's near them. Then, they have to use OpenTable or Yelp to find out if they cater to their dietary needs or tastes, as well as find pricing or a menu. Provided they found one that meets their needs, they go back to Google Maps for directions, and make their way to the Cafe. Now, let's say they become a regular and suddenly they want to attend meetups or any events happening there - especially after years of lockdowns. Now, they also need Facebook to go on the brand-monitored page and find any necessary information. A completely unintuitive experience that could easily be resolved with Cuppa.

- for problem space, set up like "have you ever gone to cafe sat  by yourself and so is everyone else, no atmosphere - imagine solution where everyone comes together, builds community"
- go into competitor analysis - these competitors dont bring everything together - "everything to bring everyone together is in one place"

### A set of interactive demonstrations of your application using ideal user scenarios. (LUCAS)

There are several ways someone might use Cuppa, and for several unique purposes.

Consider the opportunity presented earlier - this user wants to end their reliance on instant coffee, and finally have a chance at social interaction after COVID lockdowns. How would they go about both finding a new suitable cafe and attending events nearby?

Opening the app for the first time, users are asked both taste preferences and dietary requirements. The "homepage" of the app is a map, presenting you with nearby suitable cafe's as well as 3 buttons. For the purposes of this user, they may tap any of the cafe's on their screen depending on proximity. After tapping on a cafe, the overview is presented. Here, the user may find and read reviews, view images, see the address, and read general information. Additionally, buttons are present for finding directions and - more importantly - viewing events at this specific cafe. These events may be set up by users or by the cafe's managers. However, there is another way to view events if the specific cafe may not be a priority. Back at the main screen, the calendar button will take them to all events in their area. On this screen, each card represents one event - be it regular or one-time. Date, location, attendees and basic details are provided here. If an event captures the user's attention,  tapping on it will provide a more detailed view that also shows any friends attending. Scrolling down will reveal a button allowing you to sign up quickly and easily.

There are different ways to integrate socially through Cuppa though. Assume a user has already been visiting a couple of nearby cafes, and potentially wants to use the app more like Instagram or a typical social media; making recommendations or simply connecting with old and new friends. For the coffee drinkers specifically, Cuppa provides that opportunity. Instead of tapping on the calendar events icon, click on the social icon and the social feed screen appears. At the top,

### A compelling close to your presentation.

Sure, you could keep going to the same cafe you've been going to for the last 5 years, alone, by yourself. Or, you could try out Cuppa and find one that might not only excite your tastebuds, but also let you socialise and maybe learn something about the barista process along the way. All together in one app.
