1. Fatal 5 Brainstorm
	App to prevent drink-driving
		BACtrack Transdermal Alcohol Content sensor
			Integrated into an Apple Watch
			When TAC sensor notes a high TAC, gives warning. When illegal, phone will track user location (integrated with watch). Phones will auto-sync with newer cars if set up, so if it registers the user is in their car, it will sound an alarm. 
	Features:
		Alarm when in own vehicle with illegal TAC level
		Wearable integration for location tracking, TAC tracking, warnings, notifications
		Estimated BAC for users w/o sensor + "will be legal by (time)"
		Feature that allows for calling an Uber or Cab or Designated Driver
		"Plan" including emergency contacts - automated?
	Description:
		To combat drink-driving in the form of an app, 4 primary features are necessary. One: Certain wearables can track Transdermal Alcohol Content; as a result, the app should have wearable integrations. Two: Warnings and alarms. With the use of these wearables, warnings should notify a user when their TAC is high but not illegal, then again when it is over the legal limit. For users without a compatible wearable, there should also be a feature to estimate a user's BAC dependent on what drinks they have had/will have. Additionally, a "planning" section should be available that allows users to enter emergency contacts in this specific scenario, as well as Uber/Cab booking.

2. Storyboard Planning
	1 - User bored @ home making coffee, soy milk
	2 - User dislikes taste of coffee
	3 - User opens Maps, Yelp and Facebook to find cafe. Clock in corner.
	4 - User visits cafe, no soy milk.
	5 - User uses Cuppa, finds another cafe with directions, has soy.
	6 - User buys coffee, enjoys.
	7 - User looks at Cuppa events
	8 - User attends event, making and testing drinks w/ new friends.
	9 - User goes home, makes coffee @ home.

4. Low-Fi User Testing
	USER 1:
		- Buttons in top right can't be reached on a big screen
		- "Is that it?" (in relation to not knowing if they can scroll on education screen)
		- Instructions section on education card interface too small. Image too big.
		- "How do I go back?" (No navigation buttons, only gestures)
	USER 2:
		- Similar comments as User 1 on layout/sizing issues
		- "Maybe have a filter instead of a search bar, I don't know what all the different coffees are called" (in relation to the Learn screen)

5. Thematic Data Analysis
6. Persona
8. Mid-Fi User Testing
	USER 1:
		- Colours unappealing - "Make it look more like a coffee app, it's too nature-y"
		- Back buttons too small
		- "Can you tap to see the reviews or is it just showing the stars" (in relation to Screen 2)
	USER 2:
		- All buttons too small (However, prototype was viewed on an iPhone 12 Mini despite being built for the 13 Pro Max. Sizing likely not an issue there.)
		- "How do I go to the next step?" (In relation to the 4th screen)

QUESTIONS: I asked a group of friends and family not in this class to answer the follow
	"I feel like this app is visually cohesive and consistent."
	"I feel like the interactions with this app are logical and make sense."
	"I think this app is easy to use."
	"I do not think this app needs substantial feature additions."
	"I feel like this app is visually appealing."
