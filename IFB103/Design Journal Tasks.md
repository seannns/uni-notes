1. Fatal 5 Brainstorm
	App to prevent drink-driving
		BACtrack Transdermal Alcohol Content sensor
			Integrated into an Apple Watch
			When TAC sensor notes a high TAC, gives warning. When illegal, phone will track user location (integrated with watch). Phones will auto-sync with newer cars if set up, so if it registers the user is in their car, it will sound an alarm. 
	Features:
		Alarm when in own vehicle with illegal TAC level
		Wearable integration for location tracking, TAC tracking, warnings, notifications
		Estimated BAC for users w/o sensor + "will be legal by (time)"
		Feature that allows for calling an Uber or Cab or Designated Driver
		"Plan" including emergency contacts - automated?
	Description:
		To combat drink-driving in the form of an app, 4 primary features are necessary. One: Certain wearables can track Transdermal Alcohol Content; as a result, the app should have wearable integrations. Two: Warnings and alarms. With the use of these wearables, warnings should notify a user when their TAC is high but not illegal, then again when it is over the legal limit. For users without a compatible wearable, there should also be a feature to estimate a user's BAC dependent on what drinks they have had/will have. Additionally, a "planning" section should be available that allows users to enter emergency contacts in this specific scenario, as well as Uber/Cab booking.
